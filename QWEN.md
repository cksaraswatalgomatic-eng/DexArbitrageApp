# Dex Arbitrage App - Project Context

## Project Overview

This is a Node.js application that monitors decentralized exchange (DEX) arbitrage opportunities by periodically fetching balances and completed trades from remote services. The data is stored in local SQLite databases and presented through a web dashboard with charts and analytics.

### Key Features
- Polls remote endpoints every 2 minutes using `node-cron`
- Stores data in SQLite databases (one per server) using `better-sqlite3`
- Provides a web UI dashboard and JSON APIs for data visualization
- Supports multiple servers (BNB, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon) with configuration via `servers.json`
- CORS enabled for local development
- Includes ML functionality for trade success prediction
- Contract analysis integration with Etherscan-compatible APIs
- Enhanced diff analysis with trade integration

### Main Technologies
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: better-sqlite3 (SQLite)
- **Scheduling**: node-cron
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with Chart.js for data visualization
- **Networking**: axios for HTTP requests
- **ML**: Python with scikit-learn for predictive modeling

2. **Data Storage**: SQLite databases with separate files per server
3. **Data Processing**: Calculation of totals, normalization of trade properties, and aggregation for analytics
4. **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for data access
5. **Frontend**: Interactive dashboard with charts and tables
6. **Machine Learning**: Training and prediction capabilities for trade success

### Frontend Features

- Trade tables with sorting and filtering
- Exchange balance comparisons
- Server status monitoring
- Diff analysis with trade integration
- Pair and token analytics
- Machine learning analysis with correlation matrices
- Contract transaction analysis
- Responsive design with light/dark themes
- Authentication system

### Notifications and Digests
- The application supports notifications via Telegram, Slack, and email
- The "Hourly Digest" functionality has been updated to generate for all configured servers and send to both Telegram and Slack channels
- Notification conditions are now checked systematically for all servers every 2 minutes
- Fixed duplicate notification issue by adding unique keys to differentiate notification types
- Enhanced the formatting of hourly digest messages with emojis and better structure for improved readability
- Changed the hourly digest to only be sent to Slack and not Telegram
- Updated the hourly digest to display 'Gas Status' instead of 'Blacklist' with proper formatting
- Added UI elements in servers.html to expose notification rules, schedules, and thresholds for configuration
- Reverted the hourly digest cron schedule back to hourly (0 * * * *)
- Created a new Balance Update notification type with configurable schedule and channels

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- `Error: Cannot find module 'express'`: Run `npm install`
- `better-sqlite3` build errors on Windows with Node 22:
  - Install Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools with C++ workload, then `npm install`
  - Or switch to Node 20 LTS
- Port in use: Set a different port with `PORT` environment variable
- No data showing: Check remote endpoint connectivity and logs
- Python ML scripts not working: Ensure Python is installed and required packages (pandas, sklearn) are available

## Multi-Server Support

The application supports multiple servers through `servers.json`:
- Each server has its own database file (`data-{serverId}.sqlite`)
- Active server can be switched via API or UI
- Default servers: BNB, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon
- Each server can have its own contract address and explorer API configuration

## Machine Learning Integration

The application includes Python-based ML functionality:
- `train.py`: Trains a Random Forest classifier using trade and diff history data
- `predict.py`: Uses the trained model to predict trade success probability
- The model considers features like buyDiffBps, sellDiffBps, Diff, DexSlip, and CexSlip
- API endpoints allow training and prediction via HTTP requests
