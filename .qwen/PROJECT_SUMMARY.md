# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To enhance a Node.js-based DEX arbitrage monitoring application by implementing liquidity monitoring with real-time 2-minute trading volume data from Binance, adding consolidated tracking features, and improving the UI/UX with pagination and additional analytical features.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express.js, SQLite (better-sqlite3), Chart.js, Binance API, HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend
- **Database Structure**: Uses `liquidity_data` table with columns (timestamp, symbol, price, liquidity) storing actual 2-minute volumes from Binance klines API
- **Time Window Defaults**: Liquidity charts default to showing 1 day of data with "Load More" button to load previous days incrementally
- **Liquidity Calculation**: Uses Binance klines API with 1-minute intervals, combining 2 consecutive candles to calculate actual 2-minute trading volumes
- **Token List**: Supports 32+ major cryptocurrencies with USDT trading pairs on Binance
- **Frontend Features**: Includes pagination for tables (50, 100, 500, 1000 entries), dual-axis charts with price and liquidity, outlier filtering
- **Database Files**: SQLite files should be ignored in Git (data.sqlite, data.sqlite-wal, data.sqlite-shm) as they're runtime state files
- **Multi-Server**: Supports BNB, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon servers with configuration via servers.json

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Fixed Binance API interval issue by switching from unsupported 2m interval to 1m interval with volume aggregation
- [DONE] Implemented liquidity data fetching using Binance klines API, correctly calculating 2-minute volumes
- [DONE] Added "Latest Consolidated USDT Balances" table with Total row and "CEX to DEX Ratio" column (colored based on threshold)
- [DONE] Updated "Latest Consolidated Daily Profit" table to show current UTC day's profit with Total row
- [DONE] Added time-based data controls with default 1-day window and "Load More" functionality for liquidity monitoring
- [DONE] Implemented pagination for liquidity data table with 50/100/500/1000 entries options
- [DONE] Fixed database corruption issues by properly handling SQLite WAL files and ignoring them in Git
- [DONE] Added proper CSS styling for new UI elements like total rows and pagination controls

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Implement liquidity monitoring with actual 2-minute intervals from Binance
- [DONE] Add consolidated tracking features with totals and ratio calculations
- [DONE] Implement pagination for large data tables
- [DONE] Add time window controls and "Load More" functionality
- [TODO] Monitor application stability and performance in production
- [TODO] Consider adding additional token pairs to the liquidity monitoring
- [TODO] Address the notifications_log migration error if necessary for core functionality
