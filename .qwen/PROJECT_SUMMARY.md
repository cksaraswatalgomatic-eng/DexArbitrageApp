# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Fix the visibility issue of the "Outlier %" input box on the "Total USDT Balance Over Time (All Servers)" chart on the consolidated-tracking.html page in the Dex Arbitrage application.

## Key Knowledge
- **Project**: Dex Arbitrage App - A Node.js application that monitors decentralized exchange (DEX) arbitrage opportunities
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js with Express.js, SQLite (better-sqlite3), Chart.js for data visualization
- **Frontend Architecture**: Uses HTML/CSS/JavaScript with responsive design and dark theme
- **CSS Framework**: Custom styling with flexbox layouts and responsive design
- **File Structure**: 
  - HTML: `public/consolidated-tracking.html`
  - JS: `public/consolidated-tracking.js`
  - CSS: `public/styles.css`
- **Authentication**: Username=admin, password=adminpass
- **Server**: Running on port 3000 (already operational)

## Recent Actions
- Analyzed the consolidated-tracking.html file and discovered the "Outlier %" input box was already implemented in the HTML structure
- Verified the consolidated-tracking.js file had the proper JavaScript functionality for outlier filtering
- Identified that the issue was likely CSS-related rather than HTML/JS missing functionality
- Modified the CSS to fix display issues by enhancing styles for `.inline-control input` with `min-width: 80px` and `flex: 0 0 auto`
- Added specific styling for `#outlierPercentage` element with explicit visibility properties
- Updated the CSS to ensure the input box doesn't collapse in flex containers

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Analyze the HTML structure to confirm the "Outlier %" input box implementation
- [DONE] Check the JavaScript functionality for outlier filtering
- [DONE] Identify CSS issues that might hide the input box
- [DONE] Apply CSS fixes to ensure visibility of the input box
- [DONE] Verify the solution works properly
