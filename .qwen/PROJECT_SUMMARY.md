# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
The user has a Dex Arbitrage App, a Node.js application that monitors decentralized exchange (DEX) arbitrage opportunities by periodically fetching balances and completed trades from remote services, storing data in SQLite databases, and presenting it through a web dashboard with charts and analytics.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js with Express.js backend, better-sqlite3 for SQLite database, node-cron for scheduling, Chart.js for frontend visualization
- **Project Structure**: Contains app.js (main server), package.json, servers.json (multi-server config), public/ directory (frontend), and ML scripts (train.py, predict.py)
- **Features**: Polls remote endpoints every 2 minutes, supports multiple servers (BNB, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon), includes ML functionality for trade prediction, has contract analysis with Etherscan APIs, enhanced diff analysis with trade integration
- **API Endpoints**: Provides extensive RESTful API for balances, trades, analytics, diff data, ML, and server configuration
- **Database Schema**: Multiple tables including balances_history, completed_trades, server_tokens, gas_balances, diff_history, and contract_transactions
- **Environment Variables**: PORT, DB_PATH, BALANCES_URL, TRADES_URL, ETHERSCAN_API_KEY, ETHERSCAN_API_URL

## Recent Actions
- Analyzed the project structure and contents
- Created a comprehensive QWEN.md file documenting the Dex Arbitrage App with all its features, architecture, API endpoints, and data models
- Identified key files including app.js (3,500+ lines), package.json, servers.json, train.py, predict.py, and notifier.js
- Documented the multi-server support, notification system, and ML integration capabilities

## Current Plan
- The user requested performance optimization using chrome-devtools for LCP, but this tool is not available in the current environment
- [TODO] Implement performance optimization for Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) on the localhost:3000 dashboard
- [TODO] Analyze frontend performance bottlenecks in the dashboard application
- [TODO] Optimize the frontend code and assets to improve LCP metrics
